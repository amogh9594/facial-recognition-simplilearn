# Facial Recognition with Deep Learning in Keras Using CNN

## DESCRIPTION
CNN: introduction for Convolutional layer neural networks and a simple CNN for Face recognition using Keras.

## Task Need to be performed:
Step 1:  At the first, you should input the required libraries.

Step 2: After loading the Dataset you have to normalize every image.
Note: an image is a Uint8 matrix of pixels and for calculation, you need to convert the format of the image to float or double.

Step 3: Split Dataset: Validation data and Train
Validation Dataset: this data set is used to minimize over-fitting. If the accuracy over the training data set increases, but the accuracy over then validation data set stay the same or decreases, then you're over-fitting your neural network and you should stop training.

Note: we usually use 30 percent of every dataset as the validation data but here we only used 5 percent because the number of images in this dataset is very low.

Step 4: for using the CNN, we need to change the size of images (The size of images must be the same).
Step 5: Build CNN model: CNN have 3 main layer:
 1-Convolotional layer
 2- pooling layer
 3- fully connected layer
We could build a new architecture of CNN by changing the number and position of layers.

Step 6: Train the Model.

Step 7: plot the result.
